	aboutText: `I started studying programming back in 2018, when I entered college. I immediately liked this activity, soon it grew into a hobby. While in college, I didnâ€™t know what area of programming I should dive into, so I studied everything a little bit. Now I already have three years of practical experience in developing web applications. During this time, I had the opportunity to work with many technologies: Vue, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Rust, GraphQL. My web development journey began with a deep curiosity about how things work and has grown into a career where I constantly strive to learn and adapt to new challenges. I'm enjoy solving complex problems to deliver high quality solutions.`,
